It has accomplished a number of milestones over the span of time. We\r\n                have been students centric and always have strived hard for their complete\r\n                development. By the kind support of the management, sincere staff and all the\r\n                devoted stakeholders, the college has been trying to accomplish all round\r\n                development.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Immense efforts are taken at Sarhad, by empowering and educating the students, to\r\n                face the challenges at the global level and to make them talented enough to face the\r\n                future world of work. The result of this is that, our students are leaving an indelible\r\n                mark in various aspects and the same is reflected in our college vision and mission.\r\n            </p>\r\n
