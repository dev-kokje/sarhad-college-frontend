                Sarhad was founded with a unique and different purpose of providing education to the kashmiri youth as they are from the strife torn region. Sarhad was founded in 1995 to take care of the kashmiri youth who don’t get misled on the wrong path of violence. Instead, they can take formal education in Pune which is known as the ‘oxford of the east’, under the affiliated, Savitribai Phule Pune University.

                Being in the heart of the city suburb of katraj, there are number of local students who come from economically challenged families. As the fees structure is less at Sarhad College, they can avail this opportunity and empower themselves with the best education and learning.
